# How to contribute

Hey 👋 Looks like you are interested in contributing, which is just great, so welcome!

We are open to any kind of contribution: code, documentation, bug-fixing (even just reports), feature-requests and anything else you may come up with.

## Contributing

### Code

Nothing fancy here, just:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Commit you code.
3. Submit a pull request. It will be reviewed by maintainers and they'll give you proper feedback so you can iterate over it.

#### Considerations

- Make sure existing tests pass before you start working on the code.
- Make sure your new code is properly tested and fully-covered.
- Following The seven rules of a great Git commit message is highly encouraged
- When adding a new feature, branch from main.

### Testing

As mentioned above, existing tests must pass and new features are required to be tested and fully-covered.

### Documentation

Code should be self-documenting. But, in case there is any code that may be hard to understand, it must include some comments to make it easier to review and maintain later on.

### Versioning

Follows [semver](https://semver.org/).
